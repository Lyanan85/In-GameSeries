# Project Pokémon In-Game Series

### What is this?
The collective effort of the Project Pokémon to preserve and provide In-game Pokémon data.

### How do I use this?
Drag the .PKX file into the appropriate save that is opened by PKHeX.

### Help, I need description to the files. I don't understand what I'm looking at.
