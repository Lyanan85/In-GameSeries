# Project Pokémon In-Game Series

### What is this?
The collective effort of Project Pokémon to preserve and provide in-game Pokémon data.

### How do I use this?
Drag the .PKX/.GP1/.CK3/.XK3/.PB7 file into the appropriate save that is opened by PKHeX.

### Help, I need description to the files. I don't understand what I'm looking at.
In that case, please browse our gallery here: https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/category/85-in-game-series/<br>
It is pretty much filled with relevant information regarding the respective files.

### Disclaimer:
This is still a work-in-progress, and likely not as complete as our on-site gallery.<br>
While the files ARE legal, as usual, use at your own risk!
